# Pig-Game ðŸŽ²
Pig game is a  game in which player1 first roll a dice and can roll till he/she want and the number will get added to the current score and can hold it when he/she want and will get added to their total score.
And then game will get switched to player2 and that player will roll the dice then and hold when he/she want and it will get added to their total score.
But if we are rolling the dice and dice 1 comes then all the current score gets lost and turn comes of the next player.
